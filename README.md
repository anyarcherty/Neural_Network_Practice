# Neural Network Practice

#### Neural Network Practice is to practice Neural Network Algorithm with tensorflow via MINST dataset.

  * MNIST dataset
  
    The MNIST dataset has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples of handwritten digits. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image
    
#### Logistic Regression with 2 feature in MINST dataset

#### Neural Network with 2 feature in MINST dataset without tensorflow

#### Neural Network with MINST Dataset

   * Without Tensorflow
   
   * With Tensorflow


#### Conventional Neural Network with tensorflow
     
   * Low Level API
   
   * High Level API
