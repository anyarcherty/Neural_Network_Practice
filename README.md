# Neural Network Practice

#### Neural Network Practice is to practice Neural Network Algorithm with tensorflow via MINST dataset.

  * MNIST dataset
  
    The MNIST dataset has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples of handwritten digits. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image
    
#### Two features in MINST dataset

   * Logistic Regression
   
      * Stochastic
      
      * Batch
   
   * Neural Network
   
      | Dataset | Batch | Stochastic | Neural Network|
      |---------|-------|------------|---------------|
      | Train   | 0.937 | 0.960      | 0.995         |
      | Test    | 0.942 | 0.954      | 0.991         |
      
      
      | Test    | 0.942 | 0.954      | 0.991         |
