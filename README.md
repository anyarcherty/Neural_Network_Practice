# Neural Network Practice

#### Neural Network Practice is to practice Neural Network Algorithm with tensorflow via MINST dataset.

  * The MNIST dataset has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples of handwritten digits. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image
